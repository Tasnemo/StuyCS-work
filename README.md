# Stuyvesant Computer Science â€” APCS Coursework Portfolio

This repository contains my work from **Stuyvesant High Schoolâ€™s AP Computer Science sequence** (APCS1 + APCS2).  
The curriculum is a year-long, rigorous Java-based program equivalent to a first-year college CS course.  

Projects are split by **Semester 1 (APCS1)** and **Semester 2 (APCS2)**, reflecting the official course sequence.

## ðŸ“‚ Semester 1 â€” APCS1 (Foundations)

Focus: **Java fundamentals, object-oriented design, and core algorithms**

### Topics Covered
- **Java Basics**: variables, types, operators, I/O, loops, conditionals
- **Objects & Classes**: constructors, methods, encapsulation, overloading
- **Strings & Arrays**: manipulation, searching, iteration patterns
- **Recursion**: factorial, Fibonacci, Towers of Hanoi, recursive tracing
- **Sorting Algorithms**: selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort
- **Searching Algorithms**: linear search, binary search
- **AP Labs & Mini-Projects**: 
  - Number guessing & word games
  - String processing utilities
  - Intro recursion challenges
  - Sorting/simulation labs

### Skills Demonstrated
- Fluency in **Java syntax and OOP**
- Writing reusable, modular classes
- Problem decomposition and debugging
- Implementing and analyzing time complexity of simple algorithms

## ðŸ“‚ Semester 2 â€” APCS2 (Data Structures & Advanced Topics)

Focus: **Data structures, algorithm design, and larger projects**

### Topics Covered
- **Object-Oriented Programming II**: inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces
- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**:
  - Stacks and Queues (array-based and linked)
  - Linked Lists (singly, doubly, circular)
  - Trees (binary search trees, traversals)
- **Recursion & Backtracking**: maze solvers, N-Queens, pathfinding
- **Hashing & Sets**: hash tables, collisions, sets/maps
- **Sorting Algorithms II**: quicksort, heapsort, analysis
- **Graphs (intro)**: adjacency list/matrix, traversal (DFS/BFS)
- **AP Labs & Projects**:
  - Recursive Maze Solver (backtracking)
  - Word ladders & pathfinding
  - Board games and simulations
  - Mini data structure libraries

### Skills Demonstrated
- Implementation of **core data structures** in Java
- Use of **recursion and backtracking** to solve real problems
- Algorithmic complexity and efficiency tradeoffs
- Larger, multi-class projects following software design patterns
- Strong debugging and testing methodology
